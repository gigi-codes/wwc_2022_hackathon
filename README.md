# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Neural Nets

Lavanya and Giovanna are developing a mobile-based detection tool to aid in Diabetic Retinopathy detection. 

We'll be training on [data from kaggle]  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanneo/diabetic-retinopathy-resized-arranged) ad hopefully implementing [Yolo4-Tiny](https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection/yolov4-tiny-darknet)
